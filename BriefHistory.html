            <h1>Brief History</h1>
            <p>Manduyog Hill is named after the valiant Datu Manduyog who ruled Aklan at pre-Hispanic time. It served as a watch tower to warn the natives against the invading Moro Pirates. (This historical vignette has no historical basis, but has been manufactured in such a way as to acquire a hint of historical veracity, primarily through yearly programs or shows supposedly commemorating that historical event. Nonetheless, it has found no support among the established and respected historians of the Philippines, and is thus relegated as folklore of no historical provenance or significance.)</p>
            
            <p>In 1565, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi had brought upon the hispanization of Panay in the shores of Batan. That time, Christianization had begun and an indelible mark has been left by the new religion: the cross at the peak of the hill, which vanished with the passing years. After that, the people constructed life-size statues depicting the way of the cross along the winding road. The construction was supported by the college school of Aklan, the Knight of Columbus in Banga, the parish, the community, and other Catholic donors. Twenty-one years later, on June 1991, the 27-foot steel cross was replaced by a 40-foot concrete one.</p>
